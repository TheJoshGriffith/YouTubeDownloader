YouTube Downloader
=================
YouTube Downloader is a free, open source piece of software written to
avoid the massive amounts of idiocy infesting the internet with malware
and other nasty third party auto-installed junk that comes with most
free (and even some paid) YouTube Downloaders on the market today.

=================
Who made it?
=================
Me, XtrmJosh, and a few friendly people from around the internet. As
of now, I do not have the time to collect all of the links to the
websites which I have used as resources, and I apologise in advance if
I am failing to give credit in not doing so. Most laws permit me to do
do this for a minimum of 28 days before requiring that I rectify it
upon request. Should you find a snippet of your code here, please do
contact me and I will put a link to your source and some credits here
for you.

=================
How does it make you money?
=================
Not everyone on the internet is interested in making money. I am not
here to profit, nor am I here to scam nor decieve you. This software
is released to you completely free of charge. It downloads the best
quality videos and extracts the audio from them, with no extra fee
ever. There are no nuisance popups asking you to download some virus
infested anti virus software, or a piece of adware that hijacks your 
browser. It does one job, and one job alone. If you feel inclined to
pay me, you're welcome to do so by sending however much you feel 
appropriate to my Paypal (xtrmjosh@gmail.com). I offer nothing in
return for such good gestures, as I have little more to offer than my
continued contributions to the internet.

=================
What does it do?
=================
It sends a web request (as you or I would when visiting YouTube) to the
internet, which reaches YouTube and returns an HTML document. That HTML
document is then parsed to retrieve certain bits of information such as
the location of the FLV file which the website displays to us (FLV is a
video format). It fetches that FLV file, and downloads it to your PC.
After downloading, it takes that FLV file and extracts the MP3 data
which is stored within it, saves it, then deletes the FLV file to save
on hard drive space.

=================
What does it not do?
=================
On its own, it does not breach any copyrights. I've investigated this a
lot, and I can't find anything to say that you are not allowed to do
what this software does. There is an exception however, in that the
distribution of copyrighted audio files is illegal without licensing
from the owner of said copyright. Use of this software to download 
files for which you do not have permission to use / distribute may be
against the law depending on your country of residence and the state
of the copyright therein.

=================
How can you do this?
=================
I simply put my mind to it, and did it. It took me about 10 hours in 
the end, but it was worth every minute. It has been a massive learning 
curve and a good use of my time (as far as I'm concerned).

=================
Liability & Support
=================
This software is offered with zero support. I will not assist in any
way, or form, with the use nor configuration of this software. If you
are encountering problems while using it, my best advice is to learn
how it works and fix it yourself. Should you have any questions you
are welcome to send them to me via any means you have access to, I
kindly ask you not to ask me to do any software development without
first acknowledging that my time is worth money, and understanding
that I am not your bitch, nor do I intend to be.
